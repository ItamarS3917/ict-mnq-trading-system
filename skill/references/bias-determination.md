# HTF Bias Determination Rules

## Daily Chart Analysis

### Bullish Bias Criteria (need 2+ of these)
1. **Structure**: Price making higher highs AND higher lows
2. **Previous Day**: Closed bullish (close > open) AND above 50% of range
3. **Week Context**: Price above PWL and/or targeting PWH
4. **Displacement**: Recent bullish displacement candle with FVG
5. **Liquidity**: Buy-side liquidity (equal highs) above current price

### Bearish Bias Criteria (need 2+ of these)
1. **Structure**: Price making lower highs AND lower lows
2. **Previous Day**: Closed bearish (close < open) AND below 50% of range
3. **Week Context**: Price below PWH and/or targeting PWL
4. **Displacement**: Recent bearish displacement candle with FVG
5. **Liquidity**: Sell-side liquidity (equal lows) below current price

### Neutral/No Bias Conditions
- Consolidation range (no clear HH/HL or LH/LL)
- Price in middle of weekly range with no clear draw
- Conflicting signals across timeframes
- Inside day after large range day

## 4H Chart Confirmation

The 4H should ALIGN with Daily bias:
- For bullish Daily: 4H should show bullish structure or bullish displacement
- For bearish Daily: 4H should show bearish structure or bearish displacement

**CONFLICT RULE**: If Daily and 4H conflict, reduce position size or wait for alignment.

## Intraday Bias Refinement

During session, bias can be refined by:
1. **Opening range break**: Direction of first 15-30 min move
2. **Asia session**: Did Asia sweep one side? Expect opposite move in NY
3. **London session**: London often creates the manipulation move for NY reversal

## Draw on Liquidity (DOL)

Always identify where price is likely heading:

**Bullish DOL targets** (in order of probability):
1. Session high
2. Previous day high (PDH)
3. Equal highs above current price
4. Previous week high (PWH)
5. HTF order block above

**Bearish DOL targets** (in order of probability):
1. Session low
2. Previous day low (PDL)
3. Equal lows below current price
4. Previous week low (PWL)
5. HTF order block below

## Bias Scoring System

Score each factor (1 point each):

| Factor | Bullish | Bearish |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Daily structure | HH/HL | LH/LL |
| Previous day close | Above 50% | Below 50% |
| Week position | Above PWL | Below PWH |
| Displacement | Bullish FVG | Bearish FVG |
