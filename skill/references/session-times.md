## Primary Trading Window: NY AM Kill Zone (09:30-11:00 ET)

This is the **highest probability window**. Focus here.

### Why it works:
- Highest volume and volatility
- Institutional order flow most active
- Cleanest price delivery
- Best R:R setups form here

### What to expect:
- **09:30-09:45**: Initial volatility, potential stop hunts
- **09:45-10:00**: Direction often established
- **10:00-11:00**: Silver Bullet window, trend continuation

### Rules for NY AM:
1. Wait for first 15 min to pass before entry
2. Look for liquidity sweep during 09:30-09:45
3. Enter on retracement/FVG after sweep
4. Target opposite side liquidity

## Secondary Window: NY PM Kill Zone (14:00-15:00 ET)

Good for second attempt if AM didn't work.

### Why it works:
- Second wave of institutional activity
- Often reverses AM move or continues
- Silver Bullet window available

### Rules for NY PM:
1. Re-evaluate bias based on AM action
2. Look for fresh liquidity sweep
3. Smaller targets (closer liquidity)
4. Reduce position if already traded AM

## London Session (02:00-05:00 ET)

Selective trading only.

### Character:
- Creates the "Judas swing" (fake move)
- Sweeps Asia session liquidity
- Sets up NY reversal

### Rules for London:
1. Trade only if awake and alert
2. Look for Asia high/low sweep
3. Expect manipulation before real move
4. Set alerts for levels, don't chase

## AVOID: NY Lunch (11:00-13:00 ET)

**DO NOT TRADE THIS WINDOW**

### Why:
- Low volume
- Erratic price action
- Stop hunts without follow-through
- Poor R:R
- Many false signals

### Exception:
- Only if holding a winning trade from AM, trail stop and let it run

## Session-Specific Entry Rules

### London Entry
- Wait for Asia high/low sweep
- Enter opposite direction on FVG
- Target: opposite Asia extreme

### NY AM Entry
- Wait for 09:45 for dust to settle
- Identify swept liquidity
- Enter on 50% FVG
- Target: PDH/PDL or equal highs/lows

### NY PM Entry
- Reassess bias after AM
- Look for fresh setup (not AM leftovers)
- Smaller targets than AM
- Target: remaining daily range
