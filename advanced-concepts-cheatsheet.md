## Market Maker Models (MMXM)

### Model Comparison Table

| Model | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Phase 4 | Phase 5 |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **MMXM Bullish** | Accumulation | Manipulation (Low) | Distribution (Rally) | Reversal | Re-accumulation |
| **MMXM Bearish** | Distribution | Manipulation (High) | Accumulation (Decline) | Reversal | Re-distribution |

### Quick Recognition

**Bullish MMXM:**
- Consolidation → Break below support → Strong rally → Minor pullback → Continuation
- Look for: Liquidity sweep below range, then bullish displacement

**Bearish MMXM:**
- Consolidation → Break above resistance → Strong decline → Minor rally → Continuation
- Look for: Liquidity sweep above range, then bearish displacement

### Trading Rules
- Enter during Phase 3 (after manipulation confirmed)
- Phase 2 manipulation = liquidity grab (stop hunt)
- Use FVG/Order Block from Phase 2 for entry in Phase 3
- Target: Opposite side liquidity or premium/discount array

## Bias Determination

### HTF → LTF Framework

| Timeframe | Purpose | Key Elements |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Daily** | Primary Bias | Market Structure, Range (Premium/Discount), Major PD Arrays |
| **4H/1H** | Refined Bias | Confirm daily direction, Identify killzone setups |
| **15M/5M** | Execution | Entry trigger, Precise PD arrays, FVG entries |

### Bias Decision Matrix

| Daily Structure | Daily Price Location | Hourly Confirmation | **BIAS** |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|
| Bullish BOS | Discount (below EQ) | Bullish BOS/CHoCH | **BULLISH** |
| Bullish BOS | Premium (above EQ) | Bearish signs | **NEUTRAL/WAIT** |
| Bearish BOS | Premium (above EQ) | Bearish BOS/CHoCH | **BEARISH** |
| Bearish BOS | Discount (below EQ) | Bullish signs | **NEUTRAL/WAIT** |
| Range-bound | Any | Any | **NO BIAS** |

### Quick Bias Checklist
1. Daily MSS/BOS direction?
2. Price in premium or discount?
3. Hourly confirms daily bias?
4. Recent liquidity swept?
5. In proper killzone?

**If all YES → Strong directional bias**
**If mixed → Wait for clarity**

## Session Times & Killzones

### Killzone Schedule (EST/EDT)

| Session | Time (EST) | Characteristics | Best For |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Asian** | 8:00 PM - 12:00 AM | Range formation, Low volatility | Identifying range extremes |
| **London** | 2:00 AM - 5:00 AM | High volatility, Trend initiation | Breakout trades, Reversals |
| **New York AM** | 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM | Highest volume, Major moves | Primary setups, High probability |
| **New York PM** | 1:30 PM - 4:00 PM | Profit-taking, Reversals | Counter-trend, End of day |

### Killzone Priority

**Highest Edge:**
1. New York AM (8:30-11:00 AM)
2. London (2:00-5:00 AM)

**Moderate Edge:**
3. New York PM (1:30-4:00 PM)

**Lowest Edge:**
4. Asian (8:00 PM-12:00 AM) - mainly for context

### Session Interaction Patterns

- **Asian Range + London Break** = Strong continuation likely
- **London Manipulation + NY Reversal** = Classic trap pattern
- **NY AM Trend + NY PM Reversal** = Daily range complete

## Quick Decision Workflow

### Pre-Market Routine (5 minutes)
1. Check Daily: Structure + Premium/Discount
2. Check 4H/1H: Confirm or conflict?
3. Identify Today's Bias: Bullish/Bearish/Neutral
4. Note key liquidity levels (highs/lows to sweep)
5. Mark killzone times on chart

### Live Trading Workflow

```
START
  ↓
Is it a Killzone? → NO → WAIT
  ↓ YES
Check Bias (Daily + Hourly aligned?) → NO → WAIT
  ↓ YES
Identify MMXM Phase → Phase 1/4/5 → WAIT
  ↓ Phase 2 or 3
Phase 2: Liquidity Sweep? → NO → WAIT
  ↓ YES (or Phase 3 confirmed)
Find Entry PD Array (FVG/OB) → NONE → WAIT
  ↓ FOUND
Confirm LTF (15M/5M) displacement? → NO → WAIT
  ↓ YES
ENTER TRADE
  ↓
Set SL: Below/Above PD Array
Set TP: Next liquidity or 2R minimum
Manage: Trail or scale at key levels
```

### One-Sentence Rules
- **MMXM:** Wait for manipulation (Phase 2), enter distribution/accumulation (Phase 3)
- **Bias:** Daily structure + price location + hourly confirmation = directional bias
- **Sessions:** NY AM and London killzones only, unless exceptional setup
- **Entry:** Must have: Bias + Killzone + MMXM Phase + PD Array + LTF confirmation

## Risk Management Quick Reference

| Parameter | Guideline |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Max Risk Per Trade** | 1-2% of account |
| **Stop Loss** | Below/Above PD array, respect structure |
| **Take Profit** | Minimum 2R, ideal 3R+ to liquidity |
| **Max Daily Loss** | 3-5% (stop trading for the day) |
| **Position Sizing** | Calculate from stop distance to risk % |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Trading outside killzones
- Entering against daily bias
- Ignoring premium/discount (selling discount, buying premium)
- Taking Phase 1 or Phase 4 entries (wait for manipulation)
- Overleveraging or revenge trading after loss
- Forcing trades when no clear MMXM model present
